## Project Description

Omnifood is a website for a fictitious food delivery company. As shown above, the user is initially presented with a stylish hero image of a nutritious meal and also two action buttons that grab the user's attention. Clicking these buttons, akin to the navbar buttons, takes the user further down the site to the relevant section.

There's the Food Delivery Section:

and, last but not least, the Sign Up Section:
